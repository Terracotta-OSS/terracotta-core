<h2>Welcome to Terracotta Sessions Configurator</h2>

Use Configurator to setup Terracotta Sessions to cluster your existing
session-based web application.&nbsp;  Configurator provides a testing
environment complete with an installation of Apache Tomcat for clustering two
instances of a web application.<br><br>

The basic process is:<ol>

<li>Validate Unclustered WebApp</li>
Import your web application into Configurator and verify that it runs
correctly on Tomcat or other web containers you have specified.&nbsp;
In case you do not have access to a webapp of your own,
Terracotta provides a couple of sample webapps.<br><br>

<li>Iterate through the Configuration Process</li>
Run your webapp on Terracotta Sessions and identify session data that should
be clustered across the servers.&nbsp;  Restart your webapp and continue to
identify data to cluster.&nbsp;  Repeat until your webapp is properly
configured to run clustered.<br><br>

<li>Check Clustering and Fail-Over</li>
Use Configurator's real-time monitor to verify clustering of session data and
then shut down one of the Tomcat servers to verify session data is properly
maintained.<br>

</ol>

You are now ready to deploy your webapp with Terracotta Sessions and
scale-out across a large number of servers.
