           will broadcast changes in their state.

           A good idiom when writing an app that you intend to cluster via TC DSO, is to group the
           classes you wish to share under a single package (although if you follow the MVC pattern
           this tends to happen naturally) - this way the list of classes you wish to instrument
           can be concise -->
      <instrumented-classes>
        <!-- Here, we're essentially saying, treat the all of the classes found in the: 'demo.continuations', 
            package as shareable; For a "live" application, it would be a good idea to investigate 
            and declar only the classes that absolutely must be available in the cluster. -->

           section declares that all methods found for all classes found for all packages should assume the
