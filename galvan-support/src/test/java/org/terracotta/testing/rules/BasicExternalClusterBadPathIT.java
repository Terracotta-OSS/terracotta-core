/**
 * A test to ensure that a cluster can be installed in a directory with problematic characters in its path ("("/")").
 * This is to point out an issue with how a command invocation can fail, on Windows, if the path has strange
 * characters.
 * 
 * The expected behavior is that the cluster will start, a connection will be successfully established, and it can
 * be closed.  If there were a problem with the server start-up, the connection would fail.
