<!-- The following is an example of a Valve declaration to add to your application to enable
       terracotta express session clustering. 

       In the example below you will likely need to adjust the className attribute to match
       your desired application server and the "tcConfigUrl" attribute should be changed to
       match the location of your Terracotta server(s).

       The order of <Valve> elements is relevant. The Terracotta Valve should always be listed first.

       This file should be placed at META-INF/context.xml for WAR deployment on tomcat, or at
       WEB-INF/context.xml for Jboss WAR deployment       

       Tomcat 5.0.x users must add a path attribute to the <Context path="/myApp"> element since it is not
       optional in that version
-->

<Context>
  <Valve className="org.terracotta.session.TerracottaTomcat60xSessionValve" tcConfigUrl="localhost:9510"/>
</Context>
