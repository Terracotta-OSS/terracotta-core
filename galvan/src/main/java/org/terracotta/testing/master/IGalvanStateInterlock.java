/**
 * The state interlock represents the coordination of components running in different logical areas of the framework,
 *  potentially on different threads.  The general strategy is that all wait/notify operations, within the harness, must
 *  happen in the same place.  This interface is the abstract representation of that interlock.
 * While it is possible that there be many interlocks or places where multi-threaded state could be of consequence, the
 *  implementation is responsible for ensuring that they all share the same monitor so that they do not race, require
 *  explicit cooperation, or become out of sync.
 * 
 * Note that the methods which check or wait for the interlock state will also throw if the test has already failed.
