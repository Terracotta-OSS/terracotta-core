  This is an extension point for TC server logging configuration.
  This extension is done using the file inclusion feature of logback.
  Refer to https://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html#fileInclusion for more details.

  You are free to define and use your own appenders and loggers here.
  You can also use predefined TC appenders.
  Use the appender name "TC_BASE" to refer to the Terracotta base appender that logs to the terracotta-server.log file.
  Use the appender name "STDOUT" to refer to the Terracotta console appender.
