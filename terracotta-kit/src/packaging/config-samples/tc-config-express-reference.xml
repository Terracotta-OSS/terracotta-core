  This is a sample Terracotta configuration file. In it, you will find an
  example of every permitted element, along with a brief description of each.
  As such, it's a good reference, but vastly more than you need to get started.
  Very few of the elements in this configuration file are required; they are
  marked with a (REQUIRED) notation.

    <!-- The configuration model: 'development' or 'production'.

    The configuration-model element is for informational purposes. The two
    configuration-model options are 'development' and 'production'. These values
    have no effect on the functioning of Terracotta servers or clients, but
    instead allow you to designate the intended use of a configuration file
    using one of two recommended modes.

    In development, you may want each client to have its own configuration,
    independent of the server or any other client. This approach is useful for
    development, but should not be used in production as it can result in shared
    data being corrupted or lost if, for instance, two different clients specify
    roots of different types. To note that a configuration file is intended for
    direct use by a client, set the configuration-model to 'development'.

    In production, each client should obtain its configuration from a Terracotta
    server instance. To note that a configuration file is intended be be fetched
    from a server, set the configuration-model to 'production'.

    In general, a client can specify that its configuration come from a server
    by setting the tc.config system propery:

        -Dtc.config=serverHost:dsoPort

    Default: 'development'. -->

    This section defines the servers present in your Terracotta system. You can
    omit this section entirely, in which case it behaves as if there's a
    single server with all values set at their default. You can include exactly
    one server entry here (the common case), or, if you're going to run multiple
    servers for failover, you can include multiple servers here.

    If you include more than one server here, note that each server will need to know
    which configuration it should use as it starts up. If you name your servers
    according to the host that they run on (and no host contains more than
    one server), then they will find the hostname themselves and work
    automatically.

    If you name your servers in any other fashion (and, again, only if there is
    more than one 'server' element present here), then you will need to pass the
    command-line option "-n <name>" to the start-tc-server script, passing it
    the name of a server configuration from this file.

             'temporary-swap-only' causes the DSO server to use the
             disk as a temporary backing store. Data is not
             preserved across server restarts. This mode is somewhat
             faster than 'permanent-store' mode.

             'permanent-store' causes the DSO server to write data
             immediately and permanently to disk. Upon server restart,
             data will be restored, meaning data underneath roots
             in your program will be restored to the exact state it
             was in when the server shut down.

             Note that if you are using clustered DSO servers
             (you have more than one <server> element defined,
             below), then 'permanent-store' mode is recommended.
             This helps ensure proper operation of the DSO
             failover mechanism.

             of data into a Map and never remove it (merely look up
             values in it) can safely do this.

             A setting of 'false' can also be used if distributed

      - Certain parameters ('logs', below) undergo parameter expansion
        before being used by the client. This allows you to use various predefined
        substitutions (like '%h' for host), or a general one
        (%(myprop) to use the value of Java system property 'myprop'), for
        these values; expansions are carried out in each client's JVM
        independently.
  -->
  <clients>

    <!-- Where should the client write its log files?

       This value undergoes parameter substitution before being used;
       thus, a value like 'client-logs-%h' would expand to
       'client-logs-banana' if running on host 'banana'.

       If this is a relative path, then it is interpreted relative to
       the current working directory of the client (that is, the directory
       you were in when you started the program that uses Terracotta
       services). It is thus recommended that you specify an absolute
       path here.

       Default: 'logs-%i'; this places the logs in a directory relative
       to the directory you were in when you invoked the program that uses
       Terracotta services (your client), and calls that directory, for example,
       'logs-10.0.0.57' if the machine that the client is on has assigned IP
       address 10.0.0.57.
